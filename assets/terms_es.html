<h2>escondrijo rental terms and conditions</h2>
<br />
<h3>falta traducir</h3>
<p>We want you to enjoy your holiday, and will make every effort to make sure you do, subject to events that are within our control. We will always try to be fair in our dealings with you, and ask your cooperation in ensuring that we are able to extend the same commitment to our other guests, which is the context for the terms and conditions that follow.</p>
<br />
<p>--- Insurace<br />
You are strongly encouraged to arrange travel insurance to cover against cancellation costs and any loss, theft or damage during your stay. If you are an EU citizen, remember to organize your EHIC medical card ahead of time, and if not, to arrange medical cover. We will not accept liability for stolen property. The renter agrees that for any claim made against the owners of escondrijo, the maximum liability under any circumstances will be the cost of the rental.<br />
(Details of the EHIC scheme can be found here: http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Foreigntravel/BeforeYouTravel/DG_4019496)</p>
<br />
<p>--- Occupancy and rental agreement<br />
The agreement is between the owners of escondrijo and the person organising the booking ("You"), for the purposes of renting the property escondrijo for a limited period while holidaying in Vejer de la Frontera.<br /> 
- You agree to accept responsibility for the whole party staying at the property, for all payments due and any costs incurred, and for the consequences of their actions.<br />
- The rental period starts at 17:30 on the arrival day and ends at 10:30am on the departure day. You agree to vacate the property at this time at the end of the rental period.<br />
- You agree to disclose any relevant information about damage or breakages as soon as practicable and before departure at the latest.<br />
- You will notify escondrijo at the time of booking of the number of people in your party (indicating adults and ages of any children), and will not admit other visitors without the prior consent of escondrijo. In no circumstances will the stated capacity (8 adults and 4 children) be exceeded.<br />
- You are responsible for keeping the property secure, which means keeping the external doors locked at all times when not in use.</p>
<br />
<p>--- Payment schedule and security deposit<br />
A 25% non-refundable deposit is required at the time the booking is made. The balance is payable 6 weeks before arrival. In the event of cancellation, we will refund monies at our discretion where we are able to re-let the accommodation, net of any additional costs we incur, such as advertising costs or discounts offered to rent the house at short notice. A security deposit of 240 euro is payable upon arrival, and will normally be returned within 48 hours of departure. Deductions may be made for breakages or damage, missing items, or for additional cleaning where deemed necessary, or other unspecified reasons where exceptional costs have been incurred. Your liability is not limited to the amount of the security deposit.<br /><br />
In the unlikely event that escondrijo cancels the booking, all monies will be refunded immediately, and every effort made to help find alternative accommodation.</p>
<br />
<p>--- Smoking<br />
For security and the comfort of all current and future guests, SMOKING IS NOT PERMITTED anywhere inside the house at any time, though you or members of your party may smoke on the terraces.</p>
<br />
<p>--- Cleaning and access<br />
The rental price includes 2 hours of daily cleaning less one rest day per week, for which access will be required. Access may also be required for routine or exceptional maintenance. Extra cleaning can be arranged, to be paid directly to the cleaner.</p>
<br />
<p>--- Terrace shade<br />
The shade on the main terrace is retractable, and must not be used in anything stronger than a light breeze. You undertake to keep the shade drawn back overnight and in windy conditions.</p>
<br />
<p>--- Conduct<br />
You undertake to not behave anti-socially in respect of the property's neighbours, keeping noise levels reasonable after midnight, for example.</p><br />
<br />
In the event of a serious breach of the terms and conditions where you are required to vacate the property you will not be entitled to any refund for the remaining portion of the rental period.</p>
